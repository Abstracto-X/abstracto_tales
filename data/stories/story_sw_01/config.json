    "synopsis": "Alex was a software dev by day and a gamer by night, until he woke up in a galaxy far, far away. He was stuck in the scrawny seven-year-old body of Ezra Bridger, right after the Empire arrested his parents for being rebels.\n\nTalk about terrible respawn timing.\n\nNow he's trapped on Lothal, starving, powerless, and eight long years away from the Ghost crew ever showing up. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious and Vader are out there collecting skulls, and Alex knows exactly how short the average lifespan of Force-sensitives can be.\n\nRunning for the rest of his life? No thanks. He refuses to be just another street rat scrambling to survive in his second chance.\n\nIf he was going to be a space wizard, he was going to be the strongest one. Period.\n\nHis pursuit of power led him to a single, forbidden question: one that the Jedi and Sith alike would kill to bury forever.\n\nWhat if midi-chlorians (the very things that connect everyone to the Force) could be extracted, stolen, ripped from another's body and made your own?\nSome people call that heresy. He calls it survival, and maybe, if he plays this right, something a whole lot more.\n\nBecause why settle for your birthright when you can absorb someone else's.",
